"""Deterministic offline scoring.

Every scorer here is a pure function of two strings. That is a deliberate
constraint, not a limitation: a score that cannot be reproduced byte-for-byte
from the same inputs cannot be used to compare two providers, because a
difference might be the model or might be the scorer.

Model-based judging exists separately and is explicitly not part of this module.
When a judge is used its verdict is recorded alongside the deterministic scores
with the judge's identity attached, so a regression in the judge is visible rather
than silently redefining what "better" means.

# Metric semantics

* ``exact_match``  -- 1.0 only for a normalised identical answer.
* ``token_f1``     -- harmonic mean of token precision and recall. The workhorse
                      for short answers.
* ``jaccard``      -- token-set overlap. Order-insensitive, so it is robust to a
                      model reordering a list.
* ``char_ngram``   -- cosine similarity over character trigrams. Tolerates
                      morphology and minor edits where whole-token metrics are
                      too harsh.
* ``length_ratio`` -- candidate length over reference length. Reported, never
                      used as a score on its own: a long answer is not better, it
                      is just longer.
