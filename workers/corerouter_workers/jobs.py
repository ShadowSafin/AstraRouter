"""Job handling.

The interesting decisions live in the two pure functions below --
:func:`evaluate_job` and :func:`analyze_job` -- so they can be tested without a
message bus, and :func:`dispatch` is a thin router over them. A worker that
couples its business logic to a JetStream subscription cannot be tested, and
these are the parts most likely to be wrong.
