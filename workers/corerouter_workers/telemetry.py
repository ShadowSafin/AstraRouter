"""Rolling telemetry aggregation.

The control plane writes every request to ClickHouse, which answers historical
questions well and "what is happening to provider X in the last five minutes"
badly: a dashboard doing that in SQL re-scans an ever-growing table on every
refresh. This consumer keeps a small in-memory window instead and republishes
rollups, which is what the provider health panels and the routing latency priors
consume.

# Bounds

The window is bounded in two independent ways, because either alone is
insufficient:

* **time** -- observations older than :attr:`Aggregator.window_seconds` are
  dropped, so a quiet period does not leave stale numbers looking current.
* **count** -- at most :attr:`Aggregator.max_samples` latency samples are kept per
  key, so one very hot provider cannot grow unbounded between evictions.

Latency samples are bounded; counters are not. A counter is eight bytes and must
survive the window, whereas a sample list is what would actually exhaust memory.
