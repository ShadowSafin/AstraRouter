"""Optional offline judge model client.

A judge is a model asked to rate an answer, used when the reference is a rubric
rather than a string. It is strictly optional and strictly local: judging a
candidate set with a hosted provider would make the eval worker depend on the very
providers it exists to measure, and would put evaluation cost onto the bill it is
trying to reduce.

The deterministic scorers in :mod:`scoring` remain the primary signal. A judge
verdict is recorded alongside them with the judge's identity attached, so a change
in the judge is visible rather than silently redefining what "better" means.
