"""Message bus integration.

``nats-py`` is imported inside :meth:`Bus.connect` rather than at module import
time. That keeps the pure half of this package importable on a bare interpreter,
which is what makes the test suite runnable without installing anything.

# Handler contract

A subscription handler receives the raw payload and returns ``None``. Raising any
exception is the way to ask for redelivery: the bus translates that into a
negative acknowledgement. This is deliberately the only signalling mechanism,
because a boolean return invites a caller to return ``False`` by accident and
silently drop a job.
