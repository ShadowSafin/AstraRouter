# AstraRouter documentation

Everything about AstraRouter beyond the root [README](../README.md): how it is
built, how to run it, and how each part behaves.

New here? Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md) — it takes you from
empty directory to a working inference call in about five minutes.

### Security and governance

These stay at the repository root, where tooling expects to find them.

| Document | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) | Reporting a vulnerability, the credential model, console operator login, hardening before production |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Conventions, tests, commit style, which document owns which fact |

## Conventions used here

**Ports.** Examples use `http://127.0.0.1:8080` for the gateway and
`http://127.0.0.1:3000` for the dashboard. The Compose stack moves the gateway to
`18080` when `8080` is taken; set `GATEWAY` accordingly.

**Credentials.** `$AR_ADMIN_KEY` is the control-plane key from `.env`.
`$AR_KEY` is a tenant inference key minted through the admin API.

**Callouts.**

> **Note** — something worth knowing that is not essential to proceed.

> **Warning** — something that will cost you time if you ignore it.

**Cross-links.** Every document links back here and to its siblings, so you can
always find the neighbouring concept. Nothing important is documented only once:
if a fact appears in several places, the other places link to the document that
owns it.
