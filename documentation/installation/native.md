# Installation: native

Running Synapass directly on a host, with no containers. Docker Compose is the
faster path to a working stack; this is the path for a machine you intend to
operate, where you want systemd to own the processes and the datastores to be
already-managed services.

Both paths share one configuration model and the same code. Nothing behaves
differently from the container image except where it lives on disk.

Two ways to get there: the orchestrated commands below, which validate,
configure, build and supervise for you; or the manual reference after them,
step by step. Both end at the same installation.

## Orchestrated setup

`synapass native` is a deployment wrapper around the same binary: it shares
the gateway, migration and health-check code with every other path and only
adds host concerns — file locations, env files, preflight checks and process
supervision.

```bash
# From the repository root. Validates datastores, writes native.env and a
# minimal config.yaml (never overwriting yours), builds the gateway and the
# dashboard, then migrates:
synapass native install
# or: bash install/native/install.sh   (Linux/macOS)

# Check a host without changing anything (safe to run any time):
synapass native doctor

# Run everything in the foreground: gateway + dashboard, readiness-gated,
# logs to <root>/logs/, Ctrl-C stops cleanly:
synapass native up
```

Subcommand reference:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `native doctor` | Config loads, binaries exist, datastores answer, ports are free. Every failure names its fix. Exit 1 on any required failure. |
| `native install` | `doctor`, then templates, `go build`, `npm ci` + `npm run build`, `migrate`. Idempotent — re-running resumes. |
| `native up` | Foreground supervisor: gateway, dashboard, and with `--with-workers` the Python workers. Waits for `/ready` and the dashboard before reporting up. |

Useful flags (all subcommands): `--root` (one directory for config, env,
data and logs instead of system paths), `--env-file` (explicit env file),
`--with-workers`, `--skip-build`, `--skip-dashboard-build`, `--skip-migrate`,
`--skip-dashboard`, `--console-logs` (terminal instead of log files).

```bash
# Evaluation install confined to one directory, gateway only:
NATIVE_ROOT=./.native synapass native install --skip-dashboard-build
NATIVE_ROOT=./.native synapass native up --skip-dashboard
```

The dashboard needs `SYNAPASS_API_URL` (gateway as seen from the dashboard
server) and `SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY` (the gateway's own admin key); `native up`
defaults the URL to the local gateway listener. First visit still shows the
setup screen that creates the single console administrator.

## Windows

Same commands, PowerShell spelled:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install/native/install.ps1
.\bin\synapass.exe native up
```

There is no Windows service wrapper in the repository: run `native up` from
Task Scheduler (trigger: at startup) for an always-on host, or keep a console
open for interactive use. The supervisor handles Ctrl-C / service-stop
gracefully on every OS; systemd remains the Linux production story below.

## Prerequisites

| Component | Minimum | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | 1.27 | Only to build. The module pins its toolchain; `GOTOOLCHAIN` fetches it if yours is older. |
| PostgreSQL | 16 | The system of record. |
| Redis | 7 | Rate limits, budgets, credential cache. Set `appendonly yes` so counters survive a restart. |
| ClickHouse | 24.8 | Optional. Traces and analytics; inference works without it. |
| NATS | 2.10 | Optional, **with JetStream enabled** (`-js`). Eval and replay need durable consumers. |
| Node.js | 20 | Only for the dashboard. |
| Python | 3.11 | Only for the workers. |

Nothing above is required to *start* the gateway. A missing optional dependency is
reported — as a degraded check in `/ready` and as a counter in
`synapass_async_dropped_total` — rather than failing startup. PostgreSQL is the
exception: without it the gateway reports itself unready and a load balancer
should drain it.

## Datastores

Install them with your distribution's packages or from upstream. The only
Synapass-specific steps are the databases, users and the JetStream flag.

```bash
# PostgreSQL
sudo -u postgres psql <<'SQL'
CREATE ROLE synapass LOGIN PASSWORD 'change-me';
CREATE DATABASE synapass OWNER synapass;
SQL

# Redis: set appendonly yes in redis.conf

# ClickHouse
clickhouse-client --query "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS synapass"

# NATS, with JetStream
nats-server -js -sd /var/lib/nats
```

Schema is **not** created here. Synapass embeds its migrations and applies them
itself, including to ClickHouse.

## Build and install the gateway

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadowsafin/synapass.git
cd synapass

# Version, commit and build date are stamped into the binary and exported on
# synapass_build_info, which is what makes "which build is running?" answerable.
make build          # → bin/synapass

sudo install -m 0755 bin/synapass /usr/local/bin/synapass
synapass version
```

Create the service account and directories:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin synapass
sudo install -d -m 0750 -o synapass -g synapass /etc/synapass
sudo install -d -m 0750 -o synapass -g synapass /var/lib/synapass
```

## Configure

```bash
sudo install -m 0640 -o synapass -g synapass \
  config.example.yaml /etc/synapass/config.yaml
sudo $EDITOR /etc/synapass/config.yaml
```

Put secrets in a separate, tighter file. A unit file is world-readable; an
`EnvironmentFile` can be `0600`.

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/synapass/env <<EOF
SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY='"$(openssl rand -hex 24)"'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
EOF'
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/synapass/env
sudo chown synapass:synapass /etc/synapass/env
```

`SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY` is not optional in production: with `admin.require_scope: true`,
validation refuses to start without it.

Confirm the gateway sees what you intend, with secrets redacted:

```bash
sudo -u synapass SYNAPASS_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/synapass/config.yaml synapass config
```

## Migrate

`auto_migrate: true` applies migrations at startup, which is convenient for a
single host. Under change control, turn it off and migrate as a release step:

```yaml
# In the config
database:
  auto_migrate: false
```

```bash
sudo -u synapass SYNAPASS_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/synapass/config.yaml synapass migrate
```

Migrations are applied in order, recorded with a checksum, and a mismatch on an
already-applied migration is an error rather than a silent re-run. Both Postgres
and ClickHouse are migrated by the same command.

## Run under systemd

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/synapass.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now synapass
systemctl status synapass
```

The unit carries a sandbox — `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`,
`PrivateTmp`, restricted address families — because the gateway needs no
privileges and keeps no writable state.

Give the gateway the secret file with a drop-in:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit synapass
```

```ini
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/synapass/env
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart synapass
journalctl -u synapass -f
```

## Intelligence workers

The workers handle scoring, prompt analysis and telemetry rollups. They are a
separate process on purpose: that work is CPU-bound and bursty, and it must never
compete with the request path.

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0750 -o synapass -g synapass /opt/synapass
sudo -u synapass python3 -m venv /opt/synapass/venv
sudo -u synapass /opt/synapass/venv/bin/pip install ./workers

sudo install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/synapass-worker.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/synapass/worker-env <<EOF
SYNAPASS_WORKER_NATS_URL=nats://localhost:4222
SYNAPASS_WORKER_METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9101
SYNAPASS_WORKER_LOG_FORMAT=json
EOF'
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/synapass/worker-env
sudo chown synapass:synapass /etc/synapass/worker-env

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now synapass-worker
```

To enable rubric-based evaluation with a local judge, fill in
`SYNAPASS_WORKER_PROVIDER_URL` and `SYNAPASS_WORKER_PROVIDER_MODEL`. Left empty, judging is
disabled and the deterministic scorers are the only signal.

## Dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
npm ci
npm run build
```

Serve it however you prefer. It needs two variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SYNAPASS_API_URL` | The gateway as seen from the dashboard **server**, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY` | The gateway's own admin key; one value serves both |

The browser never holds the admin key: Next route handlers proxy `/admin/v1/*`
server-side. Put a reverse proxy in front and terminate TLS there.

With the standalone build:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production \
SYNAPASS_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY=... \
PORT=3000 HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 \
node dashboard/.next/standalone/server.js
```

As a service, with the same sandbox posture as the gateway unit:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/synapass-dashboard.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now synapass-dashboard
```

It reads the same `/etc/synapass/native.env` for `SYNAPASS_API_URL`,
`SYNAPASS_ADMIN_KEY` and `PORT`, binds loopback by default, and needs no
writable paths.

## Cloudflare tunnel

A native gateway can expose itself through a Cloudflare quick tunnel exactly like
the container does — the manager spawns `cloudflared` as a child process, so no
extra service is needed. See [Cloudflare tunnel](cloudflare-tunnel.md).

## Observability

The gateway exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` and exports OTLP traces to
`telemetry.otlp_endpoint`. Point Prometheus at the gateway and at the workers'
`/metrics`, and load `deploy/prometheus/rules/synapass.yml` for the alert set.

The configs under `deploy/` (collector, Loki, Promtail, Grafana provisioning and
dashboards) are written to be used directly; they assume the network names from
`docker-compose.yml`, so adjust the hostnames for a native layout.

## Verify

The same checks as the Docker path, against the native listener:

```bash
GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 DASHBOARD_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 bash scripts/smoke.sh
# Windows: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/smoke.ps1 -GatewayUrl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

```bash
# Liveness: must not depend on downstreams.
curl -s localhost:8080/health | jq

# Readiness: does check them, because this is what a load balancer asks.
curl -s localhost:8080/ready | jq
# → {"status":"ready","checks":{"postgres":"ok","providers":"2 configured"}}

# Metrics are on the same listener.
curl -s localhost:8080/metrics | grep synapass_build_info

# A real completion.
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNAPASS_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}' | jq
```

If `/ready` reports `providers: 0 configured`, the gateway will refuse traffic:
at least one provider must have a working adapter. A provider with a missing
credential is configured but has no adapter, which is the usual cause.

## Upgrade

```bash
cd synapass
git fetch --tags
git checkout vX.Y.Z
make build

sudo systemctl stop synapass
sudo install -m 0755 bin/synapass /usr/local/bin/synapass

# Migrate before starting the new binary when auto_migrate is off.
sudo -u synapass SYNAPASS_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/synapass/config.yaml synapass migrate

sudo systemctl start synapass
curl -s localhost:8080/version | jq
```

The gateway drains on `SIGTERM`: it stops accepting, finishes in-flight
streaming responses, flushes the telemetry buffer, then exits. The systemd unit
allows 60 seconds for that, which must exceed `http.shutdown_timeout` plus the
flush.

```bash
# Workers
sudo -u synapass /opt/synapass/venv/bin/pip install --upgrade ./workers
sudo systemctl restart synapass-worker

# Dashboard
cd dashboard && npm ci && npm run build && sudo systemctl restart synapass-dashboard
```
